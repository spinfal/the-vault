# The Vault
A simple to use Vault bot to store all of your text, links, and... and uh, that other stuff.

# Setup
- Create a bot on Discord's Developer dashboard
- Download as ZIP or use `git clone`
- Make sure all the files are where you want them, then setup config.json
- Modify the c0de like the hackerman you are so it looks like your bot
- Run `npm i`
- Start the bot `node .` or `node index.js`

# Issues
- Create a new Issue
  - If you don't provide the error message, or any details, I will ignore your issue.
 
# Help
- This README probably sucks, I'm tired so I'll update this later.
